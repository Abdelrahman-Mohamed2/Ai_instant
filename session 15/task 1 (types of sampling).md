# Types of Sampling 
Mainly there are 2 types of sampling

- **Probability sampling:** Probability sampling is a sampling technique where a researcher selects a few criteria and chooses members of a population randomly. All the members have an equal opportunity to participate in the sample with this selection parameter.
- **Non-probability sampling:** In non-probability sampling, the researcher randomly chooses members for research. This sampling method is not a fixed or predefined selection process. This makes it difficult for all population elements to have equal opportunities to be included in a sample.
There are types of Probability sampling and types of Non-probability sampling and each type has its characteristics.

## Probability sampling
1- **Simple random sampling:** In this method, every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. It involves randomly selecting elements without any specific pattern.

Ex: In an organization of 500 employees, if the HR team decides to conduct team-building activities. In this case, each of the 500 employees has an equal opportunity of being selected.

2- **Stratified Random Sampling:** The population is divided into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then random samples are taken from each stratum. This ensures representation from all subgroups.

Ex: A researcher looking to analyze the characteristics of people belonging to different annual income divisions will create groups according to the annual family income. Eg – (less than $20,000), ($21,000 – $30,000), ($31,000 to $40,000), etc. By doing this, the researcher concludes the characteristics of people belonging to different income groups and chooses from each group a sample.

3- **Systematic Sampling:** Selecting every kth element from a list after starting from a random point. 

Ex: A researcher intends to collect a systematic sample of 500 people in a population of 5000. He numbers each element of the population from 1-5000 and will choose every 10th individual to be a part of the sample.\

4- **Cluster Sampling:** The population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected. Then, all members within the chosen clusters are included in the sample.

Ex: The United States government wishes to evaluate the number of immigrants living in the Mainland US. In that case, they can divide it into clusters based on states such as California, Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, Colorado, Hawaii, etc. This way of conducting a survey will be more effective as the results will be organized into states and provide insightful immigration data.


There are multiple uses of probability sampling:
- Reduce Sample Bias
- Diverse Population
- Create an Accurate Sample

## Non-probability sampling
1- **Convenience Sampling:** This method involves selecting individuals who are easiest to reach or are readily available (near in other words). It is often quick and cost-effective but may not be representative of the entire population.

Ex: For example, startups and NGOs usually conduct convenience sampling at a mall to distribute leaflets of upcoming events or promotion of a cause – they do that by standing at the mall entrance and giving out pamphlets randomly.

2- **Purposive or Judgmental Sampling:** The researcher deliberately selects specific individuals based on their expertise, knowledge, or characteristics relevant to the study.

Ex: A committee decides to understand what are the factors that lead a person to select ethical hacking as a profession. Ethical hacking is a skill that has been recently attracting youth. More and more people are selecting it as a profession. The researchers who understand what ethical hacking is will be able to decide who should form the sample to learn about it as a profession. That is when judgmental sampling is implemented. Researchers can easily filter out those participants who can be eligible to be a part of the research sample.

3- **Quota Sampling:** The researcher establishes quotas based on certain characteristics (age, gender, etc.) and then selects individuals who meet those criteria until the quotas are filled.

Ex: A researcher wants to survey individuals about what smartphone brand they prefer to use. He considers a sample size of 500 respondents. Also, he is only interested in surveying ten states in the US. Here’s how the researcher can divide the population by quotas:
  Gender: 250 males and 250 females
  Age: 100 respondents each between the ages of 16-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51+
  Employment status: 350 employed and 150 unemployed people.
  Location: 50 responses per state

4-**Snowball Sampling:** This is a non-random method where initial participants refer or recruit additional participants. It is often used when the population is hard to reach.

Ex: surveys to gather information about specific illnesses. Not many victims will readily respond to the questions. Still, researchers can contact people they might know or volunteers associated with the cause to get in touch with the victims and collect information.

There are multiple uses of non-probability sampling:
- Create a hypothesis
- Exploratory research
- Budget and time constraints
