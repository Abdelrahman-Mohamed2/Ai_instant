# Types of Sampling 
Mainly there are 2 types of data

- **Continuous data:** Continuous data, measured on scales like temperature or weight, can be presented effectively through histograms for easier comparison. Analyzing this type of data reveals insights into trends and relationships not easily apparent in other datasets.
- **Discrete data:** Discrete data, with finite and distinct values like student counts or car numbers, is best depicted through bar graphs for quick comprehension.
- It's vital to grasp the type of data before employing statistical tools, as the success of the analysis hinges on choosing the appropriate tool based on the nature of the data.
