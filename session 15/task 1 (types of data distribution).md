# Types of data distribution
Mainly there are 2 types of data

- **Continuous data:** Continuous data, measured on scales like temperature or weight, can be presented effectively through histograms for easier comparison. Analyzing this type of data reveals insights into trends and relationships not easily apparent in other datasets.
- **Discrete data:** Discrete data, with finite and distinct values like student counts or car numbers, is best depicted through bar graphs for quick comprehension.
It's vital to grasp the type of data before employing statistical tools, as the success of the analysis hinges on choosing the appropriate tool based on the nature of the data.

## Continous data
### Normal Distribution:
- A symmetric bell-shaped probability distribution is characterized by its mean and standard deviation. In a normal distribution, the majority of data falls within one or two standard deviations from the mean.

### Lognormal Distribution:
- A distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. It is often used to model the distribution of stock prices and other financial variables.

### F Distribution:
- A probability distribution that arises in the context of statistical hypothesis testing. It is used in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis.

### Chi-Square Distribution:
- A probability distribution is used in statistical hypothesis testing, particularly in chi-square tests for independence and goodness of fit.

### Exponential Distribution:
- A probability distribution is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

### T Student Distribution:
- A probability distribution arises in the context of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample size is small. Widely used in t-tests.

### Weibull Distribution:
- A probability distribution commonly used in reliability engineering to model the time until a failure occurs. It can take various shapes, including exponential and normal distributions.

### Non-normal Distributions:
- A general term referring to any distribution that does not follow a normal distribution. Many real-world datasets exhibit non-normal distributions.

## Discrete data
### Binomial Distribution:
- A probability distribution describing the number of successes in a fixed number of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials.

### Poisson Distribution:
- A probability distribution that expresses the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming these events occur with a known constant mean rate.

### Hypergeometric Distribution:
- A probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a sequence of draws from a finite population without replacement.

### Geometric Distribution:
- A probability distribution that models the number of Bernoulli trials needed to get success for the first time.
